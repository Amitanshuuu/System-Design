# Day 00 – Introduction to System Design

**Date:** [Replace with current date]  
**Topic:** Why System Design? Why I'm Learning It

## What Is System Design?

System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data flow of a software system. It involves making decisions around scalability, performance, reliability, and maintainability of systems used at scale — such as messaging apps, e-commerce platforms, video streaming services, and more.

Unlike basic coding or DSA, system design focuses on **how to build software that works well when used by millions of people**, across multiple devices and regions.

## Why System Design Matters

In today's world, applications are no longer limited to a single user or a small team. They are accessed by millions, expected to be always available, fast, secure, and scalable. System design plays a central role in meeting these demands.

Some reasons why system design is important:
- Helps scale products from 10 to 10 million users
- Ensures performance under high load
- Helps architect fault-tolerant systems
- Enables clean separation of services (via microservices or modular monoliths)
- Affects hiring, team structure, and technical debt long-term

## Why I Am Learning System Design

I am learning system design to build the skills needed for:
- Performing well in system design interviews (common in backend, full stack, and SDE roles)
- Architecting robust backend projects on my own (APIs, queues, databases, etc.)
- Contributing meaningfully in tech discussions at work or internships
- Preparing for my future goals — including working on large-scale applications or pursuing an MS in CS

This skill goes beyond interviews — it's essential for thinking like an engineer, not just a coder.

## How This Journey Started

I started learning system design because I realized that while I can write backend logic and APIs, I lack clarity on how larger systems are structured. I often had questions like:
- How does YouTube stream videos instantly?
- How does WhatsApp handle billions of messages per day?
- What makes some systems fast and others slow?
- Why do companies use queues, caches, load balancers, and microservices?

This 90-day challenge is my structured effort to answer these questions, deepen my understanding, and build confidence.

## How This Will Help Me

Learning system design will help me:
- Perform better in backend roles and interviews
- Design my own scalable side projects
- Understand the trade-offs in real-world systems
- Think at a higher level of abstraction, beyond just code

It also directly supports my long-term goals like getting into a strong MS program and working in top tech companies that build complex systems.

## Format for the Next 90 Days

Each day I will cover one topic, ranging from fundamental concepts to case studies of large-scale systems. Topics will include:
- Load balancing
- Caching
- Databases and sharding
- Queues and event-driven architecture
- CAP Theorem
- Design patterns (e.g., rate limiting, consistent hashing)
- Designing systems like Instagram, Dropbox, or Uber

I'll document key takeaways, real-world examples, and questions I still have, so I can revisit and revise later.

## Closing Thoughts

System Design is not just an interview skill — it's a thinking framework that separates junior and senior engineers. By the end of this challenge, I aim to be more confident in designing systems that are reliable, scalable, and maintainable.
